## Textile Game Controller — CroBall Duo 

[Video of controller and ping-pong game](https://youtube.com/shorts/zWuDZS2cLWk?feature=share)

The CroBall Duo is a handheld game controller consisting of 2 crocheted balls - one green and one orange. This controller acts as an analog sensor and uses conductive fibers as a type of resistor. The controller works by squishing each ball to move up or down. By squishing the balls, the resitance of the fibers decreases and this is later on translated into the up - down motion for the ping-pong game where the green ball moves the platform upwards and the orange ball moves it downwards.

The controllers are connected to the circuit using alligator clips that are connected to the circuit from one end and connected to copper tape attatchments on the balls from the other end. The copper tape attachment help secure the connection and prevent the alligator clips from touching each other, which would render the controller unusable.

The materials used for this controller are as follows: 
- Non-conductive yarn
- conductive fiber filling
- copper tape
- 10k ohm resistors

While working on this controller, the most difficult part was figuring out the correct thresholds for each of the balls as the value change in the resitance is minimal and often after using the controller for some time, the fibers move out of the ball or further into the ball, changing this threshold for the resistance
